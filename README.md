# Rust Learning

Learning the rust programming language. Following [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) instructions.

Also learning from [Learn Rust](https://tryhackme.com/room/rust) from tryhackme.

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
Rust's version of NPM or PyPi. Download packages others have created.

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
Microsoft Clippy, but re-imagined for Rust to aid with development.

[RustFmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
Automatically formats Rust code

[Cargo Test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html)
A built in testing application created by the Rust developers.

[Cargo docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-doc.html)
Automatically generate documentation for your code, using documentation comments (written in Markdown). This documentation is then sent to docs.rs upon publishing to Cargo. Not to mention that examples written in documentation are automatically tested for you. No more untested documentation examples!

[Rust-Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)
Think IDE but more intelligent. Rust Analyzer clearly labels what is wrong with your code, why it is wrong, the exact characters that conflict and cause the error, and 90% of the time it provides an "auto-fix" function that automatically fixes these errors for you.

[The Rust Book & Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
Rust has a book, called The Book which details everything you could want to know about Rust. Neatly chaptered, easily searchable and at your disposal for free. If this isn't good enough, thanks to Rust's documentation comments almost every library you'll use will have extensive documentation online.
